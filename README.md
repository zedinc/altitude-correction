# Altitude Correction Factor

Estimate combustion engine power loss due to altitude change

---

This implementation came about as a result of this Mechanics.SE question: [Would a non-turbo diesel perform better in high altitudes than a comparable gasoline engine?](https://mechanics.stackexchange.com/q/21655/675)

Implemented the algorithm as per [SAE J1349 standard](http://standards.sae.org/j1349_200803/). Details can be found in the Bosch Automotive Handbook.

# Future Work

- A single Excel sheet for this simple calculation is crying out for consolidation with other automotive-related routines
